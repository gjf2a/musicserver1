# Notes on Crates I have used in this project

## Worked well
* enum_iterator
* rusb
  * Worked great, but I no longer need it thanks to midir.
* midir
  * Caveat - the first time I ran it on Windows, it failed due to a driver problem. But later, I rebooted my
    computer and it worked great.
* fundsp
  * Works great after adding in csp and anyhow crates.
* midi_msg
  * I had trouble with it initially because the USB input bytes
    had a normally-omitted channel byte that threw it off.


## Did not work well
* mvp_audio, alto
  * Panic on run
* nannou
  * Works great on Mac
  * Won't compile on Windows
* cpal
  * Documentation absolutely sucks - their demo is silence!
  * I tried experimenting but still couldn't get a sound.
  * It did work fine with fundsp
* fon/twang, glicol_synth
  * Makes no sound
* oscen
  * Example won't compile
* monotron-synth, surge-synthesizer
