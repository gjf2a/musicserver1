README for music fonts: MusiQwik, MusiSync.
Original fonts by Robert Allgeyer.

MusiQwik and MusiSync work in Windows, Mac OSX (not Mac9 or earlier),
and possibly Linux depending on how you have Linux configured.



**** MUSIQWIK:

To see how MusiQwik works, copy the following line of gibberish text into a text program,
then change the font to MusiQwik at point size 36:

'&=4Y=!==Y==Y==%F=G=X=!=%I=H=W===>V==:==.

You will see the notation of the musiqwik_demo image included with these fonts.

MusiQwik and MusiQwikB have the same characters in most locations.
However, where MusiQwik has eighth notes (quavers), MusiQwikB has sixteenth notes (semiquavers).
I couldn't fit all of them in one font file without using Unicode.



**** MUSISYNC:

To see how MusiSync works, copy the following line of gibberish text into a text program,
then change the font to MusiQwik at point size 36:

M n h ä é Ê Q W ? $ I ¶ w ú

You will see the notation of the musisync_demo image included with these fonts.



**** GENERAL:

About half the characters in these fonts cannot be reached by ordinary typing from the keyboard.
You will need to use your computer's character map program.
In Windows, the character map is usually located under Accessories > System Tools.
I recommend using a better character map utility program,
since it is easier to identify the characters when then are larger, and organized by 16 columns.
"Typecase" by Anthony Appleyard works for me on Windows:

Some characters are in a Unicode range that Windows maps to a central portion of the decimal 0-255
code range, but other systems do not. Such characters are available to you, but might not appear
in your character map program unless you scroll down to other code pages.

If you intend to use the fonts with a web page, you should screen-capture from word processor,
or write the music into a graphics program, then save as an image.
The reason is that someone viewing your web page cannot see music symbols as text
unless the correct font is installed on the visitor's own system.
Even if your visitor has the font, you would need to use HTML Entities to represent many characters.

These fonts have unusual line hights. If you find that consecutive lines overlap, simply insert
an intervening line of some other font.



**** POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:

The fonts rely on a particular way of spacing characters.
However, some applications over-ride the font instructions.
Then, there will be extra gaps between characters, or they will not align properly.
If that happens to you, try using another program. I cannot do anything about it.
